"""
This script is just to extract the data. 

Its primary goal is to match the ipa symbol to its corresponding mp3 

Eg. mp3 = IPA110.mp3, symbol=/g/

Will need to extract tbody and then extract the gif name and the ipa mp3 name. 

The symbol is actually a gif image. The gif name has features relating to it so /f/ would be xx_pul_fri_lab01.gif for 
pulmonic fricative, and lab01 refers to it being the first symbol in the fricative row and being labial 

For easier mapping to convert this fri_01 to its relevant IPA directly
